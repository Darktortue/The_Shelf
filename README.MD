# The Shelf 

The Shelf is a place where Trustedsec places capabilities that are being retired from our standard usage. 

Capabilities uploaded to the shelf are unsupported and AS IS. This repo will not accept pull requests either and they will be closed without comment. 

## Layout 

You will see the folders outlined below on the top repo level. Inside each level will be a collection of subfolders meeting that category.  
Each subfolder will contain its own README describing that project and a LICENSE file specific to that project. 

 

### Retired 

Capabilities in this folder were used in operations but have been phased out for any number of reasons. This is the best example of tools used for a meaningful amount of time at one point or another. 

### POC (Proof of concept) 

Capabilities in this folder were developed for one off usage and have not seen use beyond that initial use case. Expect to find dirty code that needs a "special touch" to make it work. 

### Unfinished 

Capabilities in this folder had development cycles poured into them, but then for one reason or another were discarded. Expect to find ideas here but do not expect things to just compile and work. 

### Scripts/Catch all folder

Capabilities in this folder are simple scripts for various pentesting purposes. The scripts are typically not polished, but should be fully functional. 

## Why? 

* This allows us to give back by putting out example code like how we consume it from several locations, further advancing the sharing of ideas. 
* It could help defenders see previously used tools to develop detections methodologies around  
* It shows our customers that we develop capabilities and shows a small sliver of what has existed to date.  

## Credits 

Where applicable, we will try to reference any projects used for inspiration in the associated project README. Its possible its been forgotten as some of these items are 5+ years old and that information may not have originally been recorded when it was though to stay an internal tool. 

Other than that, consider the whole of TrustedSec to be contributors to this project as we are very free flowing with ideas internally and many tools are the results of multiple individuals.
