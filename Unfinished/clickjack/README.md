# ClickJack

ClickJack was conceived to automate abuse of clickonce applications.
The initial idea was from here https://posts.specterops.io/less-smartscreen-more-caffeine-ab-using-clickonce-for-trusted-code-execution-1446ea8051c5

I wanted to make it simple to mass find / inject from a central point.  Parts of this application worked as intended but overall it was unreliable in the current form.  Given it was already well outlined in the specterops post how to manually take advantage of this situation in a more reliable way this effort was ditched due to not forseeing a return on investment.

Code was developed inhouse, MIT license
