# VenomousSway

VenomousSway was an internal VBA payload generation framework used for a few years. Over time paid offerings such as MacroPack Pro became attractive since they work well and have a reasonable cost.  For this reason we halted internal VBA development which makes up a small portion of the payloads we generate overall.

Most code in the repo was developed inhouse. For that reason, we are releasing this as MIT licensed.

Payloads generated from this framework successfully landed us on many clients during is active lifecycle.
