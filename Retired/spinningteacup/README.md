# SpinningTeacup

SpinningTeacup was a project designed to aleviate the pain of obfuscating vba macros.
Rather then manually templating each and every vba macro we wanted to use this project used antlr to properly identify different parts of a vba script and perform substitutions.

As we have migrated our VBA usage to MacroPack Pro this project has become unused in its current form.

Code was developed inhouse, initial vba grammer was obtained from https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/vba for which reason the project as a whole is GPL-3
